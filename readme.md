# Redeemed

This is a hasted app concept on how to make a visuall story novel on an app. I choose to write a story about myself this time but
the concept could be used for many applications such as journaling, diary, thoughts etc. The app is mear a concept, keep that in mind.
I've used React-Native-TypeScript-Tabs as a base.

## Installation

- In terminal run "npm i"

If you find this problem that I've been having with the typescript errors:

- ctrl + shift + p (on PC, default) | cmd + shift + p (on Mac, default) and bring up the menu
- type "TypeScript: Select TypeScript version" or find it in the list
- choose "Use workspace version"

This should clear up any problems, if any, after installing nodemodules with " npm i "

## Components used

RN Components:
[x] Button - also made a custom component of this one with TouchableOpacity
[x] Safe Area View
[x] ScrollView
[x] Text - default to RN
[x] View - default to RN
[x] StyleSheet - default to RN
[x] useColorScheme - default to the template i used

I was planing on adding a theme button to the project that chould change between light and dark mode but time ran out so I put that off.
[ ] themeButton

Expo Components:
[x] SplashScreen
[x] StatusBar - default to Expo projects
[x] Screens
[ ]Font - not working

## Project overview

I found it extremely hard to choose Expo components and they where really tricky to work with. A reflection whould be to build the app around
the avialable components in Expo rather then having a short hand concept that didnt really need to use any of the offered components at hand.
I also did this in two days due to sickness and family health issues. I'm not satisfied, I hope I come back to do some more work on this or
replicate it for the future. But Atleast it's presentable.
